// The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, 
// each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated". 
// Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, 
// vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

// 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.

// 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

// 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

// 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

// The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by 
// applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed—births and deaths occur simultaneously, 
// and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, 
// each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). 
// The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
